# Matrix&Vector Calculator
This program was made as my coursework on first year of Institute for Applied System Analysis (IASA), Igor Sikorsky Kyiv Polytechnic Institute.

It has 7 operations for vectors – scalar, vector, double scalar, double vector products, vector length, angle between vectors, calculation of linear equations with two variables and 9 operations for matrices – determinant calculation, matrix transpose, matrix rank calculation, inverse matrix calculation, matrix production, calculation of linear equations with two variables, calculation of matrix power, converting matrix to upper triangular form and calculation of matrix trace.
GUI developed using windows.h library.
